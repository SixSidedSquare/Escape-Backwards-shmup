Ludum Dare 21 Escape Game
=========================

This project came from a Ludum Dare 48 hour game jam, where I had a focus of simply making something which felt somewhat complete as a game.  It ended up very minimal UI and graphics, and sound did not make it in, but there is the full game loop with game over and a win condition, some story and enough simple game mechanics.
I also wanted to experiment with giving the feeling of 'escape' (the game jam theme), so played on the usual left-to-right shmup trope and reversed it, with the every approaching enemy and objects flying in at you from the left.
